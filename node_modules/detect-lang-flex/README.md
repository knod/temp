# detect-lang

**Node.js module: input text, get language it's written in. It's that simple. **

Based on Thenable Promises and thus working asynchronously, this module uses retext to analyse files & strings using Node.js

------

## Quick start

    npm install detect-lang

then:

```js
var detect = require('detect-lang');
var input = "Quand tu sauras mon crime, et le sort qui m'accable, je n'en mourrai pas moins, j'en mourrai plus coupable." // Ph√®dre, Racine, I-3.

detect(input)
    .then(function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    });
```

Output:

```js
Object {
    iso6391: 'fr',
    iso6392: null,
    terminologic: 'fra',
    bibliographic: 'fre',
    name: 'French',
    probability: '100.00',
    detected_langs: {
        fra: 1
    }
}
```

*ISO-639 is a pretty common standard. However, for best results, the output of 'iso6392' can be `null` when there are terminologic and bibliographic variants. Read the explaination of the ISO-639-2 on Wikipedia if you're confused.*
